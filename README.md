# Code Refactor

In this project, a marketing agency needed assistance with their website that meets the accessibility standards by adding semantic elements and having an orderly structured code so that the website would be optimized for search engines. 

This project serves as a good reminder that we would want websites to be accessible for everyone and to develop best practices when writing code.
